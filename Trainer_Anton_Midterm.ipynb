    ">- A common metric in descriptive analytics/statistics is the median. Roughly speaking, the median is the number that is greater than half the numbers and less than half the numbers in a list of numbers.\n",
    ">- More precisely Median is defined below:\n",
    ">>- If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers\n",
    ">>- If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    ">>- For example, 3 is the median of the list of values, [1,3,3,5,7] because it is the middle number in a odd list of sorted values\n",
    ">>- Also, 3 is the median of the list of values, [1,2,4,4] because 3 is the average of the two middle numbers in a list of sorted values\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the next cell, create a function that when passed a list of integers will calculate the median in that list. \n",
    ">- Remember, the median relates to a sorted list of values so make sure your function accounts for this if a user passes an unsorted list to the function\n",
    ">- Do not use a module to answer this question. Define your own median function. "
